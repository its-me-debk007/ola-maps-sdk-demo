# OlaMaps SDK Demo

Trying out the OlaMaps Android SDK

## Getting Started ðŸ‘£

- Add your `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` in `local.properties`:
  
  ```
  CLIENT_ID=abc123
  CLIENT_SECRET=abc123
  ```
- And that's all you need!

## Ongoing Project ðŸš§


- This is an ongoing project, and I am exploring more features available in the official OlaMaps SDK
- For now, the app shows the map around your current location
- The `access token` is valid for 60 minutes. Logic has been implemented to automatically fetch a new token when it is absent or expired
