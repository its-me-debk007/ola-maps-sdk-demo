# OlaMaps SDK Demo

Trying out the OlaMaps Android SDK

## Getting Started 👣

- Add your `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` in `local.properties`
- And that's all you need!

## OnGoing Project 🗺️📐🛠️


- This is an ongoing project, and I am exploring more features available in the official OlaMaps SDK
- For now, the app shows the map around your current location
- `NOTE`: The access token is valid for 60 minutes. I implemented logic to automatically fetch a new token when it is absent or expired
